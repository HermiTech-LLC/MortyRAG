# Project Introduction

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The RAG model combines a retrieval mechanism with a generative language model, allowing it to retrieve relevant information from a pre-constructed knowledge base and generate contextually appropriate responses.

## Architecture

The architecture is modular, consisting of several components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Prepares and processes raw data into a format suitable for retrieval.
2. **Knowledge Base**: Manages the storage and retrieval of vectorized data.
3. **Retrieval**: Retrieves the most relevant documents from the knowledge base based on a given query.
4. **Generation**: Uses the retrieved documents to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response.
5. **Controller**: Orchestrates the entire RAG process, from query input to response output.
6. **API**: Exposes the model through a RESTful API for easy integration.

## Getting Started

- Install required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Prepare the knowledge base by running the data ingestion process.
- Start the API server to interact with the model.
