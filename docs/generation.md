# Generation

## Overview

The Generation module takes the retrieved documents and generates a contextually relevant response using a pre-trained language model. This module typically uses a sequence-to-sequence model, such as T5, to craft the final output.

## Process

1. **Input Construction**: Combines the retrieved documents into a single input text.
2. **Model Encoding**: Encodes the input text using the model’s tokenizer.
3. **Response Generation**: Generates the response using the sequence-to-sequence model.
4. **Decoding**: Decodes the model’s output back into human-readable text.

## Models

This module is currently configured to use the `t5-base` model from Hugging Face’s `transformers` library, but it can be adapted to use other models as needed.

## Usage

To generate a response:

```python
response = generate_response(retrieved_docs)
```
